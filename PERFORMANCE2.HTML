    <h1>THE SEEDLING</h1>
    <br>
   <p>As a quiet little seedling
    Lay within its darksome bed,
To itself it fell a-talking,
    And this is what it said:</p>
    <p>“I am not so very robust,
        But I’ll do the best I can;”
    And the seedling from that moment
        Its work of life began.</p>
        <p>So it pushed a little leaflet
            Up into the light of day,
        To examine the surroundings
            And show the rest the way.</p>
            <p>The leaflet liked the prospect,
                So it called its brother, Stem;
            Then two other leaflets heard it,
                And quickly followed them.</p>
                <p>To be sure, the haste and hurry
                    Made the seedling sweat and pant;
                But almost before it knew it
                    It found itself a plant.</p>
                    <p>The sunshine poured upon it,
                        And the clouds they gave a shower;
                    And the little plant kept growing
                        Till it found itself a flower.</p>
                        <p>Little folks, be like the seedling,
                            Always do the best you can;
                        Every child must share life’s labor
                            Just as well as every man.</p>
                            <p>And the sun and showers will help you
                                Through the lonesome, struggling hours,
                            Till you raise to light and beauty
                                Virtue’s fair, unfading flowers</p>
